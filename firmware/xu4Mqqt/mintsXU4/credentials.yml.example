# MQTT Credentials Configuration
#
# Copy this file to credentials.yml and fill in your MQTT broker credentials.
#
# USAGE:
#   cp credentials.yml.example credentials.yml
#   nano credentials.yml  # Edit with your actual credentials
#
# NOTE: credentials.yml is already in .gitignore and will not be committed.
# NEVER commit this file with real credentials to version control.

mqtt:
  # MQTT broker username
  # If using local Mosquitto without authentication, you can use any value
  username: "your_mqtt_username"

  # MQTT broker password
  # If using local Mosquitto without authentication, you can use any value
  password: "your_mqtt_password"

# MQTT Configuration Notes:
#
# By default, MQTT is disabled in mintsDefinitions.py (mqttOn = False).
# This file is only needed if you enable MQTT.
#
# For local Mosquitto broker setup:
#   1. Install Mosquitto: sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
#   2. Start service: sudo systemctl enable mosquitto && sudo systemctl start mosquitto
#   3. Test: mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "hello"
#   4. Set mqttOn = True in mintsDefinitions.py
#
# For authentication (recommended):
#   1. Create password file: sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd your_username
#   2. Edit /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf:
#        allow_anonymous false
#        password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
#   3. Restart: sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
#   4. Update username/password above to match
#
# Security: All sensor data stays local on your network.
# External MQTT brokers have been removed for security reasons.
